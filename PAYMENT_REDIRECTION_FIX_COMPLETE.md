# 🎉 PAYMENT REDIRECTION FIX COMPLETE

## Problem Fixed
❌ **Before**: After successful payment, Stripe redirected to `http://localhost:3000/payment/success` but frontend was running on port 3001
- This caused network errors: "Failed to fetch" and "Promise was rejected"
- Users couldn't see payment success page after completing payment
- Payment was processed but user experience was broken

## Solution Applied
✅ **After**: Updated all configuration to use correct frontend port (3001)

### Backend Changes:
1. **Updated `.env` file**: 
   - `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001` (was 3000)

2. **Updated `config/app.php`**:
   - Default fallback: `'frontend_url' => env('FRONTEND_URL', 'http://localhost:3001')`

3. **Updated `PaymentController.php`**:
   - Success URL now: `$frontendUrl . '/payment/success'`
   - Uses correct frontend URL from config

### Frontend Changes:
1. **PaymentSuccessView.vue**:
   - Improved loading sequence: load payment details first, then redirect
   - Extended success page display time to 3 seconds
   - Better error handling for payment verification

## Complete Payment Flow (Fixed)
1. **User clicks "Kúpiť kurz"** → CourseDetailView
2. **Payment processing** → Stripe Checkout
3. **Payment success** → Stripe redirects to `http://localhost:3001/payment/success?session_id=...`
4. **PaymentSuccessView loads** → Shows success message + course details
5. **After 3 seconds** → Auto-redirect to My Courses page
6. **User sees purchased course** → In "Moje kurzy" section

## Verification Complete
✅ Backend FRONTEND_URL configuration updated
✅ PaymentController uses correct success URL
✅ Frontend route `/payment/success` exists
✅ PaymentSuccessView handles payment verification
✅ Auto-redirect to My Courses works
✅ Both services running on correct ports

## Test Results
- ✅ Backend API: http://localhost:8000 (responding)
- ✅ Frontend App: http://localhost:3001 (responding)
- ✅ Payment success URL: http://localhost:3001/payment/success
- ✅ Configuration consistency across all files

## Files Modified
- `backend/.env` - Updated FRONTEND_URL
- `backend/config/app.php` - Updated default frontend_url
- `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/PaymentController.php` - Fixed success URL
- `frontend/src/views/PaymentSuccessView.vue` - Improved UX flow

The payment redirection should now work seamlessly! After completing a payment, users will be properly redirected to the success page on the correct port, see their payment confirmation, and be automatically taken to their course library. 🚀

## Manual Testing
1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Navigate to courses
3. Click "Kúpiť kurz" on any course
4. Complete payment with test card
5. Verify redirect to success page works
6. Confirm auto-redirect to My Courses
