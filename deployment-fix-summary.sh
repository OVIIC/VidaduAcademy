echo "🎯 VidaduAcademy Deployment Fix Summary"
echo "======================================"
echo ""

echo "🚨 CURRENT STATUS: Laravel application not responding (all endpoints return 404)"
echo "🎯 ROOT CAUSE: Deployment failure - service is reachable but Laravel isn't running"
echo ""

echo "🛠️  IMMEDIATE REQUIRED ACTIONS:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🔑 SET MISSING APP_KEY:"
echo "   Go to Render Dashboard → vidaduacademy-backend → Environment"
echo "   Add: APP_KEY = base64:z0a3Q3u2vGAZ0dYflkfr2ELJ/CR7A6HjH44IMcpzjGo="
echo ""

echo "2. 🌍 VERIFY THESE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE SET:"
echo "   ✓ DATABASE_URL (should be auto-populated by PostgreSQL add-on)"
echo "   ✓ APP_ENV=production"
echo "   ✓ APP_DEBUG=false"
echo "   ✓ STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_... (your Stripe publishable key)"
echo "   ✓ STRIPE_SECRET=sk_test_... (your Stripe secret key)"
echo "   ✓ STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (your Stripe webhook secret)"
echo ""

echo "3. 🔗 ENSURE POSTGRESQL ADD-ON IS CONNECTED:"
echo "   In Render Dashboard:"
echo "   - Check if PostgreSQL service exists and shows 'Available'"
echo "   - Verify it's linked to your web service"
echo "   - DATABASE_URL should be automatically populated"
echo ""

echo "4. 🚀 TRIGGER MANUAL REDEPLOY:"
echo "   After setting environment variables:"
echo "   - Go to Render Dashboard → vidaduacademy-backend"
echo "   - Click 'Manual Deploy' → 'Deploy latest commit'"
echo "   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete"
echo ""

echo "📋 WHAT WE'VE DONE:"
echo "   ✓ Enhanced debug scripts for better diagnostics"
echo "   ✓ Fixed routing issues in Laravel"
echo "   ✓ Generated APP_KEY for secure deployment"
echo "   ✓ Identified the root cause (deployment failure)"
echo ""

echo "🔍 AFTER FIXING - VERIFY WITH:"
echo "   Run: ./database-check.sh"
echo "   Should show:"
echo "   ✅ Health check: OK"
echo "   ✅ Database connection: working"
echo "   ✅ Debug endpoints: accessible"
echo ""

echo "⚠️  COMMON RENDER DEPLOYMENT ISSUES:"
echo "   - Missing APP_KEY (most common)"
echo "   - Database not connected properly"
echo "   - Environment variables not set"
echo "   - Build process failing due to permissions"
echo ""

echo "📞 IF STILL NOT WORKING:"
echo "   1. Check Render 'Logs' tab for specific error messages"
echo "   2. Check 'Events' tab for deployment failures"
echo "   3. Verify nixpacks.toml configuration"
echo "   4. Ensure start-render.sh has proper permissions"
echo ""

echo "🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:"
echo "   - Health endpoint returns 'healthy'"
echo "   - Debug endpoints show database connection"
echo "   - Course API endpoints respond"
echo "   - Admin panel is accessible"
echo ""

echo "⏰ NEXT STEPS TIMELINE:"
echo "   1. Set APP_KEY (1 minute)"
echo "   2. Verify other environment variables (2 minutes)"
echo "   3. Trigger redeploy (1 minute)"
echo "   4. Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)"
echo "   5. Test with database-check.sh (1 minute)"
echo "   Total time: ~7-8 minutes"
echo ""

echo "🏁 Ready for deployment fix - $(date)"
echo "💡 Remember: The backend was working before, so this is likely just missing APP_KEY!"
