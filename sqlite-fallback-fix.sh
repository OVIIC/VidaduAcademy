echo "==============================================="
echo ""

echo "üìã CURRENT SITUATION:"
echo "- PostgreSQL driver still missing after deployment"
echo "- Admin panel still shows Error 500"
echo "- Need immediate working solution"
echo ""

echo "‚ö° TEMPORARY FIX: Switch to SQLite"
echo "================================="
echo ""
echo "This will get admin panel working immediately while we fix PostgreSQL"
echo ""

echo "üéØ STEPS TO APPLY TEMPORARY FIX:"
echo ""
echo "1. Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/"
echo "2. Find your 'vidaduacademy' service"
echo "3. Go to 'Environment' tab"
echo "4. Find 'DB_CONNECTION' variable"
echo "5. Change value from 'pgsql' to 'sqlite'"
echo "6. Click 'Manual Deploy'"
echo "7. Wait 2-3 minutes"
echo ""

echo "üîç VERIFY THE FIX:"
echo "================="
echo "After deployment:"
echo "1. Go to: https://vidaduacademy.onrender.com/admin"
echo "2. Login: admin@vidaduacademy.com / admin123"
echo "3. Admin panel should work without Error 500"
echo ""

echo "üìä TEST DATABASE CONNECTION:"
curl -s "https://vidaduacademy.onrender.com/debug-db" | grep -A 10 -B 5 "SQLite\|Database connection"

echo ""
echo "üí° WHAT THIS DOES:"
echo "=================="
echo "- Switches from PostgreSQL to SQLite database"
echo "- SQLite file is stored locally on the server"
echo "- Admin users and data will be recreated"
echo "- Admin panel will work immediately"
echo "- Can switch back to PostgreSQL later"
echo ""

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT NOTES:"
echo "==================="
echo "- This is a temporary fix for immediate functionality"
echo "- SQLite data is local to the server instance"
echo "- For production, we should fix PostgreSQL driver issue"
echo "- All admin users will be recreated with SQLite"
echo ""

echo "üîÑ ALTERNATIVE: Force PostgreSQL Driver Install"
echo "=============================================="
echo "If you prefer to fix PostgreSQL instead:"
echo ""
echo "1. Check if deployment is using Apache instead of nixpacks"
echo "2. May need to add PostgreSQL packages to Dockerfile"
echo "3. Or use different PHP buildpack with PostgreSQL support"
echo ""

echo "üèÅ Choose your fix:"
echo "=================="
echo "Option A: Quick SQLite fix (recommended for immediate use)"
echo "Option B: Debug PostgreSQL driver issue (longer term)"
echo ""
echo "üéØ Admin credentials remain the same:"
